Why a Layered Network Model?
• Reduces complexity
• Standardizes interfaces
• Facilitates modular engineering
• Ensures interoperable technology
• Accelerates evolution
• Simplifies teaching and learning

The Seven Layers of the OSI Model:
Application
Presentation
Session
Transport
Network
Data Link
Physical

Application Layers (Upper
Layers):
• Network Processes to Applications
• Data Representation
• InterHost Communication

The Seven Layers of the OSI Model:
TRANSPORT LAYER:
End To End Connections:
• Handles transportation issues between hosts
• Ensures data transport reliability
• Establishes, maintains and terminates virtual circuits
• Provides reliability through fault detection and recovery
• Information flow control

NETWORK LAYER:
Data Delivery:
• Provides connectivity and path selection between two host systems.
• Routes data packets
• Selects best path to deliver data
• The Network layer prioritizes data known as Quality of Service (QoS).

DATA LINK LAYER:
Access to Media:
• Defines how data is formatted for transmission and how access to the network is controlled.

PHYSICAL LAYER:
Binary Transmission:
• Defines the electrical, mechanical,procedural, and functional specifications for activating,maintaining, and deactivating the
  physical link
